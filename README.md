# Data-Wrangling-and-Visualization
In this repository, we've delved deep into diverse datasets, showcasing our ability to wrangle, analyze, and visually represent data for extracting meaningful patterns and insights.

Capital Metro Data Analysis: We analyzed Austin's Capital Metro data, focusing on UT-Austin's student travel habits. We've uncovered fascinating trends related to time of day, week, and temperature effects on ridership.

Billboard Chart Analysis: We've navigated through the dynamic world of the music industry, pinpointing patterns in song popularity, lifetimes on charts, and the hallmarks of a chart-topping hit.

Wine Chemistry and Classification: Using advanced techniques like PCA and t-SNE, we've dissected the chemical properties of Vinho Verde wines. Our analysis sought to determine if it's possible to differentiate between red and white wines, or even discern wine quality levels, solely based on chemical components.

From understanding the commuter rhythms of UT-Austin students, to decoding the intricacies of chart music success, and demystifying the chemical composition of wines, we've tackled diverse questions with data. It's a journey through numbers, patterns, and stories waiting to be told.
